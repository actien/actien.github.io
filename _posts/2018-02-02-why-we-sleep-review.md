*TL;DR*: This book blew my mind on how important sleep was. Everyone should try to get 7-9
hours of sleep consistently if possible. It will improve your memory and your health, and
drop your chances of disease. #1 tip on how to accomplish this: sleep and wake up at the
same time every day, even on the weekends.

## How Sleep Works/History

* Used to be mystery why humans needed sleep, but there is literally NO evidence of
anything bad from sleeping.
* There are two primary mechanisms of what makes us sleepy: our internal circadian rhythm
and the concentration of a hormone called adenosine.


### Internal Circadian Rhythm

* Our circadian rhythm is actually independent of sunlight. Some scientists tested this by
staying in a totally dark cave without sunlight and attempted to track the days that
passed. It was pretty accurate, and our body's perception of a day is actually ~25 hours.
The body uses sunlight to adjust it's own clock, and overall it is easier to just have
everyone do 24 hours (time earth takes to complete one rotation).
* Sunlight DOES help you adjust the internal clock, but at most it only adjusts by ~1
hour. So traveling 8 hours to a different timezone will take 8 days before you fully
adjust and can sleep properly.
* Humans are roughly half/half in terms of how shifted their
internal clock is--so some of us are naturally "night owls" while others are "morning
larks"

### Sleep Pressure/Adenosine

* Adenosine is a "sleepy hormone". It accumulates while you are awake and it builds up
what he calls "sleep pressure". After 12-16 hours of wakefulness, people usually feel
sleepy, and that's when adenosine has reached critical concentration.
* At some point your adenosine concentration will be so overwhelming that you won't be
able to stay awake.
* Caffeine blocks your receptors for adenosine, causing you not to feel sleepy. But it
doesn't remove the hormone, so it will continue building up while your receptors are
blocked. This is why you'll feel a crash at some point after caffeine wears off--this is
when sleep pressure is overwhelming.
* Caffeine in your system peaks at 30 mins after oral consumption, but has a half life of
5-7 hours. So if you drink some coffee after dinner at 7 PM, you'll still be struggling to
feel that sleep pressure at 1 AM.

Your two systems operate completely independently of each other. This is why sometimes
when your sleep pressure is really strong, and you decide to take a nap, it's hard for you
to fall asleep later when your internal clock decides it's time to sleep, since your
adenosine concentration got purged earlier.

Generally, to assess whether you are getting enough sleep, Walker suggests the following 2
checks:

* Can you fall back to sleep easily after waking up in the morning? If yes, then you are
likely not getting enough sleep.
* Can you function optimally in the morning without caffeine? If no, then probably not.

Practically, I think being aware of when you are consuming caffeine and when you are
napping puts this into light. It's easiest to manage if you are consistent in your sleep
schedule, and either eliminate caffeine or only have some in the morning.

## Phases of Sleep/Functions

* Sleep has two phases, NREM, REM which means non-rapid eye movement, and rapid eye
movement. Functionally, you can think of NREM as moving memory data from short term memory
to long term memory, while REM builds up connections between different ideas.
Both types are equally important, but when deprived your brain will use more of NREM
first, before switching to REM.
* Generally, REM sleep is associated with our emotional IQ. Walker argues that this is so
important (since human society is largely built on social connections) that he posits that
REM sleep is what allowed humans to be where they are today.
* If you deprived a baby/child of REM sleep they would grow up to be socially abnormal.

### Sleeping and Age

* As you get older, your brain can't deep sleep as much. People often say older adults don't
need as much sleep, this is false. They need the same, but they aren't getting the same
quality/quantity, have decreased sleep efficiency, and experience disrupted timing.
* Typically associated with bad sleep as you get older are: medications, weakened bladder.
* Also, your circadian rhythm shifts earlier as you get older, so you get sleepy when you
would typically want to be out socializing. And then by the time you get in bed, there
isn't much time before your circadian rhythm thinks it's time to wake up again.
* Teens actually have a circadian rhythm that is shifted later, so they naturally don't
get sleepy until later in the night. Walker thinks that our school system where we are
starting early are really messing with our kids. He mentions some studies where they made
school start later and performance improved across the board.


### Why You Should Sleep
* Improved memory creation/solidification. Sleeping before and after will improve your
learning.
* NREM sleep is the primary force here.
* Continued lack of sleep adds up. After 10 days of 7 hours of sleep per night. You are
cognitively operating as if you had not slept for 24 hours. So chronic sleep impairment
slowly builds up impaired performance.
* You can't get lost sleep back, sorry.
* When you are sleep deprived, you poorly judge how sleep deprived you are.
* Drowsy driving is more dangerous than drunk driving, since you have *micro sleeps* where
your brain literally shuts off.
* As always there are exceptions--some people have a certain gene that allow them to get
by with little sleep. These people are extremely rare. one in a thousand million. you are
probably not one of these people.
* When we are sleep deprived, we are much more prone to mood swings.
* Sleep is also big factor in predicting likelihood of alzheimers.

### Sleep and Health
* Sleep is foundation of health. (I had a fitness coach call it the *engine* for your
fitness. Your diet and exercise are just wheels. You can't go anywhere if you don't have a
good engine!)
* The less you sleep the less you'll live--ironic since sleeping is close to being dead
* Diet/Weight loss: sleep loss increases hunger/appetite, weakens impulse control, reduces
effectiveness of fat loss. Basically shits on all your diet progress.
* One night of sleep deprivation inflicts damage on your system, you'll more likely to
have heart attack.
* 4 hours loss of sleep drops your natural killer cell count by 70%
* sleeping 6 hours vs 7 hours results in 40% increased likelihood for cancer
* Sleep deprived individuals have cancer cells that are really aggressive. So sleeping
less makes you more likely to get cancer and makes your cancer cells super strong.

### Dreams - why? what's benefits
* Dreams help us resolve emotional situations
* Teach us to navigate emotional/social cues
* Makes connections for new ideas to non logical prior memories. When you dream you can
jump from idea to idea much more rapidly.

### Why we are sleeping poorly and what to do about it
* Artificial light messes up your natural melatonin release. Melatonin tells your body
"it's time to get ready for bed." Fix this by avoid blue light exposure at night. Get Flux
for your phone, computer, swap out your light bulbs.
* Alcohol at night will rob you of your REM sleep, and ruins anything you learned. 
(Takeaway is that boozy brunch is bae)
* Your room is too hot. Your core temperature needs to fall about 1-2 degrees C, 2-3
degrees F for you to fall asleep. 65 degrees F is best temperature given clothes and
cover. Also take a hot shower so that blood rushes to your hands, feet, face. This helps
expel heat from your body and cools your core.
* Sleeping pills are terrible. Don't take them.
* Make your room really dark. Make it a sleeping haven.
* Establish regular bed/wake times, even on weekends.
* Remove screen tech from your bedroom (aka your phone/digital alarm clocks)
* If you can't fall asleep for 20 minutes, get up and do something quiet and relaxing for
a while until you feel sleepy.
