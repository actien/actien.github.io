### Hello 2017!

Setting up a personal website has been a project that I have wanted to get done for a while. Spending the holidays at home meant I had a ton of free time on my hands, so in an effort to do something productive instead of mindlessly watching Youtube videos, here's a meager attempt to set something up. Sadly I couldn't get themes working yet so we'll work on that sometime later.

2016 felt much longer than usual, but a lot of things came together this year. Highlights from this year for me:

* Moved to live by myself - Living with a roommate was a ton of fun and I miss that sometimes but I had the fortune to strike out on my own this year so I took it. It has been a while since I lived by myself and doing it again toward the latter half of this year has taught me a lot about the value of introspection.
* Regular friend group - I've more or less established a regular friend group. I see these people at least one or twice every two weeks, and it's great to always have a goto crowd of folks who are down to do things together.

New Years Resolution wise.. none in particular stand out. Mostly it is a continuation of the goals I already had before the year arrived. Still, it's fun to think about setting the tone for 2017. In that light, the goal is to say _no_ to more things. Be more choosy about who I spend my time with and what I spend my time doing.

Cheers, 2017. Here's to another growth filled year.
