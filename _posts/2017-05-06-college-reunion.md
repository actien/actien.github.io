### College Reunion

I recently attended my 5 year reunion. Typically most people say, "wow, five years passed so 
quickly, I can't believe it!" For me, this is partly true. In other ways, however, these five years
have been filled with memories and thus feels like a long time in retrospect.

I didn't make a concerted effort to tell my friends I was going to the reunion--I felt that it would
be way more fun to meet new people and pleasantly be surprised running into old people.

This was exactly how the reunion turned out. It was slow at times but I got to reconnect with a lot
of people from my year. They are all doing great in their lives and it was a pleasure to spend a 
night or two catching up with them all.

I spent a lot of time walking around the old stomping grounds and had a fantastic time. I
was usually alone but I didn't feel lonely. I found myself lost in the memories that would be
triggered from seeing cues on the old campus.
