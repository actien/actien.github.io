title: "Fitness"
---

I grew up with little interest in being fit or healthy. I think I was quite obsessed with video games and did my best to avoid doing other things. My parents also often denied me the opportunity to take part in fitness activities, favoring things like music and academic studies. It wasn't until college that my interests really took off, since I finally had the chance to do whatever I wished. I've tried a lot of sports, but in this note I will mostly discuss my experiences with weight training and overall pursuit of aesthetics/strength.

Aesthetics is typically the term people use to describe the physique of well-known bodybuilders such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Frank Zane. For me being aesthetic reminded me of most of the characters on Dragon Ball, a manga I read religiously growing up. These characters are _ripped_. They have high amounts of muscle mass and low body fat. I think anyone who grew up being a fan of the Dragon Ball franchise has thought about how great it would be if we could turn super saiyan, which is an fiery physical transformation that the main character, Goku, learns at some point through the series. When angered, Goku was able to channel his rage and transform into a Super Saiyan, tremendously increasing his power levels and also turning his hair blonde and eyes blue. (I've always wondered if the author had some sort of obsession with blonde hair and blue eyes.) I dreamt of being abe to do this when I was a little child but reality set in at some point and eventually I developed a more realistic view of what being fit meant.

When I think of fitness, I like to consider it as the pursuit of your greatest physical potential.
